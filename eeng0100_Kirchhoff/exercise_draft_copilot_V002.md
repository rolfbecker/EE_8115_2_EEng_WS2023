# First attempt to create an exercise about Kirchhoff with MS Copilot

**My prompt:**

```
Please help to create an exercise on Kirchhoffs laws. Please create three loops with three voltage sources.
```

**Copilot Output (after a few more itenrations on output format):**

(The circuit diagram is wrong).

## Exercise: Kirchhoff's Laws in a Circuit

### Given:
- A circuit with three loops (loops A, B, and C).
- Three voltage sources: $$V_1$$, $$V_2$$, and $$V_3$$.
- Four resistors: $$R_1$$, $$R_2$$, $$R_3$$, and $$R_4$$.

### Circuit Diagram:
```
     V1                V2                V3
  +----(\)----R1-----(\)----R2----- (\)---+
  |           |            |             |
 R4           |            |             R4
  |           |            |             |
  +----R3-----+----R2-----+----R1-------+
```

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Label the Loops and Components:**
   - Loop A (left loop): Contains $$V_1$$, $$R_1$$, and $$R_3$$.
   - Loop B (middle loop): Contains $$V_2$$, $$R_2$$, and $$R_3$$.
   - Loop C (right loop): Contains $$V_3$$, $$R_1$$, and $$R_4$$.

2. **Apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL):**
   - For Loop A: $$V_1 = I_1 R_1 + I_3 R_3$$
   - For Loop B: $$V_2 = I_2 R_2 + I_3 R_3$$
   - For Loop C: $$V_3 = I_2 R_2 + I_4 R_4$$

3. **Apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at Junctions:**
   - At Junction 1: $$I_1 = I_2 + I_3$$
   - At Junction 2: $$I_4 = I_3$$

### Given Values:
- $$V_1 = 24V$$
- $$V_2 = 12V$$
- $$V_3 = 18V$$
- $$R_1 = 3\Omega$$
- $$R_2 = 2\Omega$$
- $$R_3 = 6\Omega$$
- $$R_4 = 1\Omega$$

### Calculate Currents:
Using the given values, the equations become:
1. For Loop A: $$24V = 3I_1 + 6I_3$$
2. For Loop B: $$12V = 2I_2 + 6I_3$$
3. For Loop C: $$18V = 2I_2 + 1I_4$$
4. $$I_1 = I_2 + I_3$$
5. $$I_4 = I_3$$

### Steps to Solve:
1. From Loop C: $$18 = 2I_2 + I_3$$ -> $$18 = 2I_2 + 6$$ -> $$I_3 = 6A$$
2. Substitute $$I_3 = 6A$$ into the equation for Loop A: $$24V = 3I_1 + 6 \times 6$$ -> $$24 = 3I_1 + 36$$ -> $$3I_1 = 24 - 36$$ -> $$I_1 = -4A$$
3. Substitute $$I_3 = 6A$$ into the equation for Loop B: $$12V = 2I_2 + 6 \times 6$$ -> $$12 = 2I_2 + 36$$ -> $$2I_2 = 12 - 36$$ -> $$I_2 = -12A$$

### Questions:
1. Write the KVL equations for each loop.
2. Write the KCL equations for the junctions.
3. Solve the system of equations to find the current through each resistor.
4. Verify that the sum of voltages in each loop equals zero as per KVL.
5. Verify that the sum of currents entering and leaving a junction equals zero as per KCL.

### Hints:
- Use Ohm's law $$V = IR$$ to express voltages in terms of currents and resistances.
- Solve the system of linear equations simultaneously to find the unknown currents.

Now the variables should render correctly in a Markdown viewer that supports LaTeX. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
